# Dangerous Domains

# Project Info
WARNING READ!!!: All URLs in this repository SHOULD be considered DANGEROUS. Do use any URL within this project on a browser, unless you are security researcher and understand the risk(s). I do not verify these links if they are active still or not, instead if links have had any history of being used for scams, phinishing or spreading dangerous content they will stay on here reguardless if they have any sort of active dns/ownership

# Why?
This project started for moderation bot I made for an online community. Scams and phinsing is a large issue that is not like "tech support scam", instead the culture is to use services like Grabify to steal IP and DDOS/Dox users, other attacks involve using steam to steal vitural items/accounts for profit. Majority of blacklist on Github focus around malious domains, but not kind of attacks / domains I see in online culture/gaming communties. This list is tailored to online communties and links used to target users online. I may expand project into more links in the future.
