# Dangerous Domains
WARNING READ!!! All URLs in this repository SHOULD be considered DANGEROUS. Do use any URL within this project on a browser, unless you are a security researcher and understand the risk(s). I do not verify these links if they are still active or not, instead if the links had any history of being used for scams, phishing or spreading dangerous content they will stay on here reguardless if they have any of active dns/ownership. 

## Why?
This project started for a moderation bot I made for an online community. Scams and phishing is a large issue in my community. Many are not the "tech support scams" you see out in the wild, instead the culture is to use services like Grabify to steal IP and DDOS/Dox users, other attacks involve using steam scams to steal virtual items/accounts for profit. Some even exist to steal session tokens/logins to take over accounts to launch spam campaigns or seize control of large communties for malious intent. Majority of the blacklists on GitHub focus around malicious malware domains, but not kind of attacks / domains I see in the online culture/gaming communities. The goal is to create lists tailored to the online communities and the links used to target online users. I may expand the project into more links in the future.

## Project Contains
https://steamcommunity.com/ (safe) and its commonly used scam sites for CSGO, Rust and other skin sites used to deceive or steal accounts/skins (items of value).
  
https://discord.com/ (safe)  - URLs used to steal login credentials for use in spam campaigns or to maliciously target people.

https://grabify.link/ (safe-ish)  - Website used to "grab" a user's device and IP/location infomation when clicked. This can be used for scare tactics or to gather infomation otherwise impossible to gather on most server side chat/game services. Quite dangerous for Twitch/YT streamers who can be DDOS'ed if their IP is leaked.
